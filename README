I needed a very simple json parser to run on older blackberry JVMs.

All the json parsers I could find required lots of huge jars or Java 5 classes.

You just call handleStream on this object and then look at either rootTable or rootVector.

If your json looks like:

["foo1", "foo2"]

Then rootTable will be null and rootVector will have the data.

If your json looks like:

{"foo1": "foo2"}

Then rootTable will have the data and rootVector will be null.
